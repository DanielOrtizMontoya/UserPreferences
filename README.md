## Description


### Producer

This component has an API that receives JSON and sends it to the messaging broker (RabbitMQ). The producer is a simulation to emulate the messages generated by other microservices.

### Messaging broker

This component uses RabbitMQ to receive and forward all messages generated by the microservices. This component is deployed in docker.

### Microservice

The microservice is divided into 4 components, separating the functionalities.

 #### EntryPoint RabbitMQ

 This component is in charge of subscribing to the messaging broker. Receive the messages and send them to the Controller.

 #### Controller

 This component is in charge of reading the messages, carrying out the business logic and executing the Store's functions.

 #### Store

 This component establishes the connection with the database. Run the necessary read and write commands.

 #### EntryPoint HTTP

 This component has an API that receives requests and returns user preferences.

### Database

The database used in this project is an instance of Neo4j (graph-oriented database). This database was used because it is better than traditional relational databases, if you work with related information. This component is deployed in docker.
